The Hello World and Voter examples included here are intended to
be used with example projects shipped with the main distribution.
You will need to have a server running with the appropriate catalog
for these examples to work.

You will need to copy voltdbclient.py to the examples directory for
the examples to run.

Hello World requires no arguments and connects to localhost.

Voter has seven arguments:
    [number of contestants]
    [votes per phone number]
    [transactions per second]
    [client feedback interval (seconds)]
    [test duration (seconds)]
    [lag record delay (seconds)]
    [server list (comma separated)]

A reasonable default invocation that connects to localhost is:
./voter.py 6 2 100000 5 120 3 localhost
