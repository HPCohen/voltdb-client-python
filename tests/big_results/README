This test exercises the VoltDB Python client with a large result set. It is
based on a stripped down version of the Voter example, with the addition of the
BigResults stored procedure to generate an artificial large result set.

To enable profiling change G.profile to True in test.py.

To use this test:

- Compile the stored procedure and catalog, and start the server using "./run.sh".
- Run the test using "python test.py".
- Stop the server using Ctrl-C or by calling the @Shutdown system procedure.

Note that the catalog and store procedure can be separately recompiled using
"./run.sh catalog".
